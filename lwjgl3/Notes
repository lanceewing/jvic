NOTE 1: LWJGL3 does not support multitouch, which means that the libgdx desktop backend 
does not support multi touch. This is turn means that jvic on desktop does not support
the joystick movement and fire simultaneously, which is rather annoying. For this reason
it is recommended that the physical keyboard controls are used instead, rather than the
onscreen joystick control, in fact a future version may choose to hide those controls in
the desktop version. This mainly affects devices such as Microsoft Surface tablets and
laptops that provide a hybrid touch screen and physical keyboard.

NOTE 2: Regarding the above, multi touch does work on "desktop", if you are using the web
version of jvic on a desktop machine. The web browser supports multitouch on desktop devices
such as Microsoft Surface tablets without any issue, so using the jvic web version is a 
workaround. Same physical machine different behaviour. The issue is that LWJGL hasn't yet
implemented multitouch support and its a feature that has been pending for many years, so
unlikely to be supported any time soon.
